        <strong>My name is Joe Sak, I'm a 6th year senior at Michigan State University.</strong><br/>
        I've been studying Game Design for 3 years now, going on 4.  I searched for 
        a few years trying to find a major that interested me.  My first 5 semesters 
        of college were in 5 different majors.  Fifth time is apparently a charm however 
        seeing how I have settled in to Media and Information.  I've since held three jobs
        in the field of game design, and have distinguished myself through:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Games for Entertainment and Learning(GEL) Lab employee</li>
        <li>Empathetic Games Program employee</li>
        <li>Indiginous Peoples Games Project employee</li>
        <li>Developing and Publishing 2 games</li>
        <li>Official Steam Partner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Combining this with 20+ years experience of playing board and video games, creating
        my own video games on my calculator in high school, and the countless homebrew board
        games I've created, I believe I am in the right place for me.
