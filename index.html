            <h2>Learning to Love the Hammock</h2>
            <p>
                When I was young, hammocks were obviously death traps designed to dump their
                occupants onto the ground without any warning or care for the users wellbeing.
                I never understood why people liked sitting in hammocks when chairs exist and
                are probably safer than hammocks.<sup title="Citation Needed"><a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/citing">[*]</a></sup>
                With this being said, my mom bought a hammock for the backyard 4 years ago.  I
                was obviously horrified at the prospect of having a murder machine in my own 
                backyard, and naturally had to try it out.  My life in the following years has 
                never been the same.  Basking in the Michigan sun, swaying gently in the breezes
                that float through the area, it is wonderful.  I have admittedly fallen asleep and
                fell out of the hammock <em title="Twice"><u>once</u></em> but I was unharmed and continue
                to rest atop the misunderstood masterpeice of backyard comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for you to appreciate and enjoy your very own hammock, allow me to provide some 
                tips:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not panic if it leans</li>
                <li>Do not have a dog big enough to lean on it and knock you out</li>
                <li>Try laying across the hammock before the advanced move of laying along it</li>
                <li>When attempting to dismount, lean to the side you want to exit on then sit up</li>
                <li>Stay out of garden hose range</li>
                <li>Sunburns</li>
                <li>Sudoku or Crossword puzzles are highly recommended</li>
                <li>And last but not least: Relax</li>
            </ul>

                <em><strong>Avimos Corp is at it again.</strong></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The year is 2310, and it’s time for the ten year harvest.  
                Ever since 2090 all crops have been grown on manmade asteroids orbiting the sun.  After nuclear winter 
                killed off croplands on Earth, and sabotage was rife within any greenhouse and biodome in the world, all
                crops have been grown off world, to avoid the sabotage of the planet.  Every decade Earth’s orbit and
                the manmade asteroids, lovingly nicknamed Plantoids, intersect for harvesting.  Planting and seeding 
                are all taken care of, but a human hand is still needed to retrieve the condensed nutrients.
            </p>
            <p>
                This worked wonderfully for centuries, growing enough food for most of humanity.  The issue arose with 
                the fanatical people of the world.  Splinter factions who were convinced that humanity should have died 
                out with the nukes, long ago had mastered sabotaging any plants on Earth, except their own obviously.  
                The Plantoids were a defense against them, moving food production outside of their reach, until Avimos 
                Corp was formed.  A combined powerhouse of a company, they created their own space program, and suddenly
                even outer space was close enough to sabotage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Defenses were equipped on Plantoids as an arms race began.  A few tumultuous decades later a sort of 
                stalemate was reached.  Avimos Corp couldn’t get close enough to the Plantoids to destroy them, and the
                Plantoids couldn’t hit Avimos ships from that far away.  Avimos still managed to have the upper hand
                though, using radiation weapons of unknown origin to destroy crops from afar.  No large radiation 
                shielding had yet been found effective, nothing larger than a shoebox could be made safe from the 
                radiation, making the only viable option for the rest of the world to get their food was a manual
                extraction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Operators were drafted, trained, and sent out to harvest what they could.  The radiation Avimos used was 
                lethal to humans as well, but it required substantially longer exposure to reach levels dangerous to the 
                Operators.  Operators were tasked with getting to the Plantoids first, extracting plants, loading up their
                radiation containers with all the food they could, before returning to their ship and flying back to Earth.
                A good Operator would finish their run with food aplenty and a long lifespan without side effects, other
                than being rich, ahead of them.  An Operator who was bad at their job would bring significantly less food
                home, and die within a couple years from the radiation poisoning.  Some Operators performed so badly they
                didn’t even survive the return trip, dying on the flight back leading to ground crews having the 
                unpleasant task of extracting whatever food there was off of the radiated corpse.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pay is good, the mission righteous, and after all, who doesn’t want to go to space.  Your training is 
                done, and it’s time to do your part for humanity.  Welcome Operator, don’t let us down.            
            </p>
